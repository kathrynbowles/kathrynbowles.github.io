									<p>
										Dr Filipa Henderson-Sousa joined the Bowles lab in 2023 to investigate the early molecular mechanisms underlying tauopathy using iPSC models. 
										She completed her PhD in Dr Barlow’s lab at Edinburgh Napier University and then moved to the Netherlands to join Bogaert’s group as a 
										postdoctoral fellow. She also delved into the world of industry where she worked on developing iPSC-derived cardiac cell organoids. She enjoys 
										long-distance bike rides around Scotland in the summer (too cold in any other season), trail running (also a summer activity) and weight lifting 
										(all-year-round activity). She also enjoys reading– anything and everything – and beach holidays, mainly in Portugal where she is originally from. Filipa
										is working on understanding the role of <i>ELAVL4</i> expression on tauopathy pathogenesis in iPSC-organoids.

								<a class="image featured"><img src="assets/KathrynNewton.JPG" alt="" /></a>
								<p>
									Kathryn graduated from Aberdeen University with a BSc in Genetics and her first job was working for the Medical Research Council studying pattern formation in hind limbs. 
									She moved on to a stem cell lab and has never looked back.  She has mainly worked with stem cell differentiation protocols, histology, molecular biology and microscopy. 
									She has continued to work as a Research Technician preferring to be playing in labs rather than stuck in an office writing grants and papers.  She loves holidays in the 
									sunshine mainly Madeira, swimming in the sea and snorkelling. She also enjoys cooking and tries to run twice a week to keep fit all year round weather permitting. In the lab, Kathryn
									is establishing and supporting iPSC and organoid differentiation protocols and QC across multiple projects.

									<a class="image featured"><img src="assets/Lois_crop.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										Lois graduated from the University of Edinburgh with a BSc in Biomedical Sciences with honours in Anatomy and Development. She remained in Edinburgh to 
										undertake an Masters by Research in Neuroscience in the Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences,  investigating the spread of pathological tau in tauopathies. 
										She joined the Bowles lab as a Research Assistant in 2023 and started her PhD in 2024. She enjoys music and crochet, and has recently started climbing. Lois has been working on our Rainwater funded project
										to investigate neuron-glia interactions in primary tauopathies and is now investigating disrupted ELAVL4 subcellular localisation.

									<a class="image featured"><img src="assets/dianne2.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										Dianne obtained her PhD in Biological Sciences at the University of Southampton under the 
										supervision of Dr Katrin Deinhardt. Using cultured neurons, microscopy, luminescence assays 
										and electrophysiological techniques, she investigated the molecular mechanisms of tau propagation
										 in tauopathies. She joined the Bowles lab to investigate the role of a novel astrocytic <i>LRRC37A2</i> gene 
										 in Parkinson's disease using iPSCs. She enjoys playing sports all-year-round (e.g., netball, volleyball 
										 and ultimate frisbee), hiking and wild swimming. Besides her love for sport and outdoor activities, she 
										 has a passion for dancing and in arts and crafts, recently discovering a new found love for landscape painting.

									</header>
									<a class="image featured"><img src="assets/headshots/alex2.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										Alex graduated from the University of Applied Sciences Darmstadt with a BSc in Biotechnology and from the Technical 
										University Darmstadt with a MSc in Biomolecular Engineering. He obtained his PhD in Neurobiology and Neurodegeneration 
										at the University of Liverpool which included him undertaking his final year of research at the Perron Institute in Perth, 
										Australia. During this time, he investigated the role of transposable elements in neurodegenerative diseases using a combination 
										of wet lab and bioinformatic approaches. Alex joined the Bowles lab to investigate astrocyte dysfunction in primary supranuclear 
										palsy and other tauopathies using iPSCs and human brain tissues. Outside of lab, Alex enjoys outdoor activities (e.g., football, running, 
										hiking and skiing), travelling, as well as enjoying some time indoors, whether it’s catching the latest movie at the cinema, bowling 
										or trying out new restaurants.

									<p>
										Dr. Paula Beltran-Lobo joined the Bowles Lab in 2025 to study the interactions between astrocytes and the vasculature in tauopathies funded by an Alzheimer’s Society 
										Postdoctoral Research Fellowship together with the Diaz Castro lab at the University of Edinburgh – UK DRI. She obtained her PhD in Neuroscience from 
										King’s College London (KCL) in 2022 under the supervision of Prof. Wendy Noble and Dr. Beatriz Perez-Nievas, where she investigated the role of astrocyte and microglial 
										P2X7R-mediated inflammatory signalling in Alzheimer´s disease. She expanded her work during her postdoctoral research in Dr.  Maria Jimenez-Sanchez’ lab at KCL exploring 
										astrocyte-neuronal interactions in tauopathies with a focus on extracellular chaperones as a crosstalk mechanism. Outside the lab, she enjoys painting, cat sitting, travelling and wandering around Edinburgh.

									<a class="image featured"><img src="assets/headshots/Dana.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										Dana graduated from the University of Limoges with a Bachelor's degree in Life Sciences, specializing in Cellular Biology and Physiology, 
										and is currently pursuing a Master's degree in Health Engineering, with a specialization in Cellular Engineering, at the University of Poitiers.
										Last summer, she completed an internship at the Neuroscience and Mental Health Innovation Institute in Cardiff, Wales, where she worked on 16p11.2 copy number variations and neurodevelopmental disorders.
										She really enjoys listening to music - her tastes are very diverse, and include songs in several different languages. She also loves reading, watching comedy shows, and travelling.

									<p>
										Carolina is currently studying Medicine and Surgery at the University of Ferrara, Italy, and 
										will be graduating next year. Her goal is to pursue further studies in the field of Neurology, 
										both in clinical practice and research, because she's deeply passionate about understanding the 
										nervous system in every aspect. She has been practicing ballet since she was a child, and in her free 
										time she loves trying all kinds of sports. She also enjoy traveling and experiencing new things. Additionally, 
										Carolina really like going to concerts and events, as she loves immersing myself in live music and sharing special 
										moments with others.
